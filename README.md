# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate machine learning projects built using Python, `scikit-learn`, and related libraries. These projects demonstrate a variety of core ML techniques including regression, classification, and model evaluation.

Each project is self-contained and includes:
- Source code (`.py` or `.ipynb`)
- Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Project-specific `README.md` files with instructions and explanations

## Projects

### ðŸ“ˆ [OLS Linear Regression on Diabetes Dataset](./ols-diabetes-regression/)
A simple linear regression model trained on the BMI feature of the diabetes dataset. Includes evaluation using mean squared error and RÂ² score, plus a regression plot.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Feature selection
- Model fitting and prediction
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`

### ðŸ’³ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/puniaa/numpy-projects/tree/main/FraudDetector)
Located in [`numpy-projects`](https://github.com/puniaa/numpy-projects), this project uses logistic regression and random forests to identify fraudulent transactions in a real-world dataset.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Binary classification
- Class imbalance handling
- Model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
- Confusion matrix visualization

## Tools & Libraries

- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas` (next projects)
- `seaborn` (next projects)

## Next Projects

- K-Means customer segmentation
- Multivariate linear regression
- Spam detection with NLP
- Neural network playground

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anannya-punia/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
   ```

2. Go into any project folder and follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

## Goal

To continuously grow a portfolio of ML projects that show real understanding of modeling, metrics, and experimentation â€” not just applying models blindly.
